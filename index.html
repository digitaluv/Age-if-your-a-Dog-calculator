    <h1>Dog Years</h1>
        <p>Dogs mature at a faster rate than human beings. We often say a dog’s age can be calculated in “dog years” to account for their growth compared to a human of the same age. In some ways we could say, time moves quickly for dogs — 8 years in a human’s life equates to 45 years in a dog’s life. How old would you be if you were a dog?
        
        Here’s how you convert your age from “human years” to “dog years”:
        
        The first two years of a dog’s life count as 10.5 dog years each.
        Each year following equates to 4 dog years.</p>
